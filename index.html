            <p style="width: 520px; text-align: justify;">
                The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

                You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).
            </p>
            <input type="file" id="day2-input">
            <button onclick="getOutputDay2()">Get output</button>
            <p id="day2-output"></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Day 3</h2>
            <p style="width: 520px; text-align: justify;">
                The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a "part number" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)
            </p>
            <input type="file" id="day3-input">
            <button onclick="getOutputDay3()">Get output</button>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Day 4</h2>
            <p style="width: 520px; text-align: justify;">
                As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.
